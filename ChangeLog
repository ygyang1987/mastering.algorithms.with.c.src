The orgininal source code was downloaded from Oreilly website.
Some modifications have been done:
	change dos text file format to unix text file format;
	delete suffix '.exe' in '.mak' files, for that suffix is nosence in unix;
	rename 'source' directory to 'src', as well as replace the directory name in '.mak' files;
	replace makedepend with Tromey's auto-dependencies method;
	add makefile for all examples.

To make all examples: make.
To clean all files generated by compiler: make clean.

After all, the source code in these files are excellent, which will help us in enhancing c programming.
